# Java
This example code includes operations on a 2 dimensional matrix in Java. 
The first one includes rotating a matrix by 90 degrees. You would observe that rotating is basically the action of converting rows to columns and vice versa.
The second example includes checking elements of a matrix and if any element is zero, then it converts the corresponding entire row and column to zero.
